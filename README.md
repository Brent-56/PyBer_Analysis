# PyBer_Analysis.

### Overview 
The purpose of this assignment was to create analysis and visualizations you produce will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services. This project would also be able to compare a fare for different city types such as urban, suburban, and rural. Through this analysis we would also be able to determine number of drivers and riders for each different city type. From here information can be gathered to determine what would be the best course of action to resolve the issues regarding affordability and accessibility. There was a need to divide the city types into three categories because each city type has a unique set of issues, they face which often requires a unique response to the problem. 

###  Results
In 2019 the Rural city type had 125 rides. The suburban city type had 625 rides; and urban had the most rides with 1625.

### Summary
For the summary Urban has the most rides, drivers and is most expensive in terms if fares. However, the average fare per ride is the cheapest amongst all the city types and has the cheapest average fare per driver. Suburban has 490 drivers, has $19,356.33 in terms of fares, averages $30.97 in terms of fares per ride and averages $39.50 fare per driver. Rural seems to have the lowest number of rides, drivers, and total fare price. However, it is the most expensive by average fare per ride and fare per driver. Rural has a total of 78 drivers, $4327.93 total in fares, average fare per ride of 34.62, and fare per driver is 55.49.
